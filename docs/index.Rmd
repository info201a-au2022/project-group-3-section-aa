## What is this file for?
In this file we are here to  analyze datasets of various cancer types and their treatments in different parts of the United States Also, we have data visualization on different cancer cases related to different races.
Our purpose of this project is not only aiming to assist people in this community to reduce their number of cases and increase survival rates based on our insightful analysis, but we also want our project to make people pay more attention to cancer prevention.


* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
<<<<<<< HEAD
### Example 1: In this By_races source. We using the source that we loaded and form a data sets with age_group", "cases", "population", "ethnicity", "frequency",  "gender". We have the cancer cases by different ethnicity and find the proportion by using the each ethnicity cases dividing the total cases. And here is the our source, and the code is below.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
source("../source/by_races.R")
source("../source/female_only.R")
source("../source/by_year.R")
source("../source/table.R")
=======
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/by_year.R")
test()

```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
kable(by_age_groups)

```



## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
chart_female
chart_races
chart_year
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
